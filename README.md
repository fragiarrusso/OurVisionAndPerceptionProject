# OurVisionAndPerceptionProject
The aim of our project was to try several model for the generation of painting with Gans then making a comparative analysis between them.
We compared the base  model of Dc Gan, with some variants like LSGan and Relativistic Gan also changing optimizers and performing different transformations on dataset.
then we implemented a model of Wgan and improved Wgan, 
finally we implemented a cycle gan.

In the code for brevity we show only few of the trials, if you are interested in more generated images can be found at the following link
