The aim of our project was to try several model for the generation of painting with Gans. making a comparative analysis.
We compared the base  model of Dc Gan, with some variants like LSGan and Relativistic Gan also changing optimizers and performing different transformations on dataset.
then we implemented a model of Wgan and improved Wgan,
